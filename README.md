# Xilinx DNNDK 3.0
The Xilinx DNNDK Version 3.0. All credit goes to Xilinx, Inc. and I have no role in the making of this product or any relationship to it.
I solely am providing this toolset because Xilinx seems to have crashed the link to the *DNNDK 3.0* and I can't find it anymore.

More info on that in a post in the [Xilinx Community Forum](https://support.xilinx.com/s/question/0D52E000072B3ZJSA0/where-is-the-dnndk-download-located?language=en_US).

**Disclaimer:** I am not resposible for any damage or problems caused by using this. 

Any information and documentation for the *DNNDK 3.0* is provided in the [DNNDK Documentation (Xilinx UG1327)](https://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/user_guides/ug1327-dnndk-user-guide.pdf).

**For Xilinx:** If you don't want me to host this anymore, I will take it down immediately.
